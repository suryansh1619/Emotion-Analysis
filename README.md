# 😊 Emotion Analysis
This project is a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**-based solution for analyzing emotions in text data. It classifies text into multiple emotion categories using **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques.

# 🚀 Features
- Classifies text into multiple emotions, such as joy, sadness, anger, love, fear, and surprise.
- Utilizes **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction.
- Provides detailed performance insights using **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrices**.

# 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled text samples categorized into different emotional states. It has been preprocessed to remove noise, tokenize text, and perform stemming/lemmatization.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling
- **NLTK** for text preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models and evaluation
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for model development and training  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
<!-- SMOTE (imbalanced-learn) for handling class imbalance -->
<!-- Tomek Links (imbalanced-learn) for cleaning noisy samples -->
# 📊 Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved high classification accuracy after balancing the dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Improved F1-score across all emotion classes.
<!-- - Class Balance: Minority emotions were balanced using SMOTE, and noisy samples were removed using Tomek Links. -->
